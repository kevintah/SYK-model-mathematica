# SYK-model-mathematica
Added a function to calculate spectral form factor after following work cited here from 
another author (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU-_3BTftrY) .  This code has been modified and added to.
It now contains technics for 

--eigenvalues,

--eigenvectors,

--spectral form factor, 

--growth rate and so on
